Electribe SX Command Line Tools README
--------------------------------------

Intro

The Electribe SX is a wicked box but it was made before USB was generally available on such instruments. Hence, loading samples requires copying them to a card, and even then, the Electribe only allows loading them singly. So if you have, say, a load of nice vintage drum machine samples, it’s a laborious process to get them all where you want them.

Hence this collection of tools, which make bulk sample loading and a few other things a lot easier. The general idea is that you get yourself a card for your Electribe and a reader for your computer, then use these tools to generate “all” files, which are then copied to the card and loaded into your Electribe.

Command Line Tools?!?

Yes, sorry, no GUI here. For this kind of job, I prefer having driver files in which I can copy and paste, etc, instead of having to make 300 trips through a file dialog to locate samples. It’s easy, trust me, and much faster than the other way.

Facilities

These tools essentially allow you to import Wave files into your Electribe via its “all” file format.
